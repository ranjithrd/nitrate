# Nitrate
Nitrate is a simple React starter that won't get in your way. It comes built in with some great technologies, and is super simple to install and use. 

### Technology

1. [ReactJS](https://vite.dev)
2. [Vite](https://vite.dev)
3. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwind.css)
4. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)

### Usage

You can create a new project using the `npx` command that Nitrate offers, or manually clone this repo yourself (see instructions below)

1. Create a project using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npx nitrate new YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
   ```

2. Navigate to your directory and install dependencies with the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn
   # OR
   npm i
   ```

3. Start the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   # OR
   npm run dev
   ```

Otherwise,  you can directly clone this repository using 

You'll have to (i) remove the `cli` folder, the `.git` folder, and the `LICENSE` file, (ii) modify `README.md` with something relevant, and (iii) uninstall the dependency `lithium-cli`.

That's all that Nitrate's about. If you liked Nitrate, please do checkout [Lithium](https://lithium.js.org), my other project upon which Nitrate's CLI is built upon.
